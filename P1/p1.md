## Question 1

Completed

## Question 2

1. I think that the value of `s` will cycle between values going from positive to 0 to negative.
2. It should just continuously keep adding 1024 to `s` for $10 \times 1048576$. However, we hit the integer overflow limit.

When we run it without any optimisation it does as I suspected in part 1.

Running it with optimisation essentially stops the cycling and fixes `s`.



I didn't expect this one argument to make such a big difference in the behaviour of the code.


The `clangInt` executable doesn't produce any weird behaviour. perhaps the quotation marks or tilde's are wrong.

## Question 2.3

I expect the float to be converted to an int.

## Question 3 

When we divide two negative integers `-5` and `-2` we get 2. I suspect this is because we truncate the true answer 2.5 to 2 because of type casting. If we wanted the actual value one of `-5` or `-2` would have to be a double type to force the output to be a double.
